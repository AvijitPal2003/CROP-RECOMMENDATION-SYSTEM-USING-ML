# CROP-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-USING-ML
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation by analyzing soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It helps farmers maximize yield, minimize risks, and make data-driven agricultural decisions.
